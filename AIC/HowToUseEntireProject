comany will add text to the textarea on QuestionGeneration.html page
then this text will save in inputText File
then first step is generate the question from that text so we will run
    question_generation/runnow.py file it will update intents.json file in Main AIC folder

then we apply paraphrasing for creating one question to more questions for accuracy so we will run
    OneQueToManyQues/main.py file it will update in Main AIC folder's intents.json. it will add more simmilar que for mapping and
    accuracy

then this intents.json file of Main AIC folder's content is copy to AIC_APP/training/intents.json file manually
then now we have to run training.py file in training folder which train the data of the AIC_APP/training/intents.json file
now all are done just open terminal, shift to Main AIC folder (cd AIC) and then type "python manage.py runserver" in terminal
and we are good to go
