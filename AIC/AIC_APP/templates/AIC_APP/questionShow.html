            <p>The most important thing is that you want to learn something that interests you, because once you start learning, you’ll be with this topic for a while. Choosing something just because it’s popular or what others are doing isn’t the way to go because if you don’t have a true interest in it, you’ll lose the motivation to learn! Spend some time seriously looking into the different tech career paths before choosing one to go down.</p>

          <div class="accordion__content">
            <p>I usually tell most people to start by learning HTML and CSS, then move into learning JavaScript. The reason is that JavaScript is used everywhere: frontend, backend, and even to build mobile apps. It has many use cases, which is why I think it’s smart to learn.</p>

            <span class="accordion__caption"><i class="far fa-lightbulb"></i>Is it possible to do both graphic design and coding?</span>
          </button>

          <div class="accordion__content">
            <p>If you have an interest in coding and graphic design, then there’s nothing to say you shouldn’t learn skills in both areas. They often work hand-in-hand, so having knowledge and skills in both areas could be desirable for certain career paths. You could also think about pursuing something in between like UI design, which is a very in-demand career right now!
              <br><br>
              In general, having design skills along with coding skills is helpful. But it’s also okay to do one over the other. My advice would be to just get started! You can always change directions later… as long as you’re changing directions to the final destination you’re looking for!
